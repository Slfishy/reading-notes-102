## Reading 2


# InstallFest!! 

Reading 2 is all about getting my computer set up for coding. I setup my Terminal and installed many programs to get going.

The terminal I am using is called **Ubuntu.** It's an integrated scripting environment in Windows that helps me to input code that will make changes on my computer. An add-on feature which allows me to use a Linux-based operating system, (like Ubuntu) connected right to to my terminal.

Homebrew is an add-on tool that makes it easier to install applications on my computer from my terminal. Homebrew describes games and other software made by consumers of who own computer hardware platforms, such as game consoles, that have hardware constraints and are not user-programmable most of the time.

Node.js is used for making applications with JavaScript. *Originally* Node was made for use as a web application, but the author found it could be used for more general purposes and renamed it.

Git is a program that keeps track of the changes that have been made to the code. Git is an open-source, freely given version control program made to handle everything from small to large projects quickly and efficiently.

Tree is An add-on I installed that lets me use the command ‘tree’, so I can view my files in a tree format.

VSCode is a code editor Microsoft made, full of helpful extensions I can install that make coding faster, more simple, more accurate. Another code editor that can be used is Notepad or Notepad ++ which are to be made in plain text.
