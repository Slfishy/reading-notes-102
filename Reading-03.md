# Git Review

Git is a *version control system* that lets you to work on a **local** copy of a project, then you sync it.

### Here are some key Commands:

- git add .	Stages all untracked files in the working directory, ready to commit
- git commit -m "description message"	commits staged files with a custom message
- git pull	pulls  changes down to the local repository
- git push	Pushes local changes to the remote repository

### Git stores files in three different ways.

1. Modified, meaning the file has been changed or edited but not committed.
2. Staged, which means the file is flagged as ready to be committed.
3. Committed. This means the file is stored in local database.
