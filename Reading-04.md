   <h1> <strong><em>Reading 04 Review</em></strong> </h1> 
   <p> Mozilla uses a fox <a href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/10/firefox-logo-100690302-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70">logo</a> as its logo and I think it's really cool. </p>
   
   <p>Firefox is a good browser but I like Google Chrome better.</p>
   
  <h2> Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are better than: </h2>
  
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer</li>
  <li>Opera</li>
</ul>

<p>I wouldn't recommend the browsers I listed to my greatest enemy. </p>
   
   <p> <em>I hope you liked my presentation on the hierarchy of browsers.</em> </p>
